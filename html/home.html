			<p>The Landscape Pattern Monitoring Portal is designed to guide you through a landscape pattern change workflow, allowing you to monitor how natural and anthropogenic events have affected landscapes.</p>

			<p>There are three tool components:</p>
			<a class="internal-link" href="data-page"><h4>Collect Earth Online (CEO)</h4></a>
			<p class="tab">Web application for collection training and reference data for remote sensing projects</p>

			<a class="internal-link" href="map-page"><h4>Cover Mapper</h4></a>
			<p class="tab">Web application to create cloud-free Landsat composites for two points in time, perform change detection, and create land cover classifications</p>

			<a class="internal-link" href="frag-page"><h4>Landscape Metrics</h4></a>
			<p class="tab">Tutorial on how to analyze landscape patterns using an R script and land cover classifications from Cover Mapper</p>

			<p>Depending on your resource management needs, you can work through all three tools or you can use just one. Click any of the tool names to get started.</p>

			<p>The Cover Mapper tool and the Landscape Pattern Monitoring Portal were proposed by USDA, Forest Service (USFS) personnel working in the Pacific Northwest Region (Region 6) and developed collaboratively with the <a href="https://apps.fs.usda.gov/gtac/" target="_blank">Geospatial Technology and Applications Center (GTAC)</a> with support from the Geospatial Technology and Applications Steering Committee (GeoTASC).
