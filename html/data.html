			<h3>What</h3>
				<p class="tab"><a href="https://collect.earth/" target="_blank">Collect Earth Online</a> is a free and open source web app for collecting training and reference data for geospatial applications, such as land cover classifications. CEO offers simultaneous, cloud supported data entry by multiple users and enables crowd-source visual interpretations of high-resolution satellite and aerial imagery.</p>
				<p class="tab">In order to create a land cover classification, the Cover Mapper uses something called a supervised classification algorithm (specifically, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest" target="_blank">random forests model</a>). The “supervised” portion of “supervised classification algorithm” means that you need to teach the algorithm what each category in your classification looks like in the imagery, which you do by providing examples. </p>

			<h3>Why</h3>
				<p class="tab">In Collect Earth Online, you can easily create a new set of data points, view and interpret high resolution imagery, and provide attributions for those points – and you can do it all in the same place! Unlike many desktop GIS software packages, Collect Earth Online doesn’t require any software installation.</p>
				<p class="tab">For groups or individuals working outside of the Southern Blues project area, the basic training dataset we’ve provided won’t be of much use – you’ll need to create your own base dataset before getting started with the Cover Mapper.</p>

			<h3>Who</h3>
				<p class="tab">The average user probably won’t have to interact with Collect Earth Online much (if at all), however each project or study area will likely require a small group of Collect Earth Online users.</p>
				<p class="tab">In order to create a training dataset for land cover classification with CEO, you’ll need at least one person to set up a project (admin) and three people to collect data (interpreters/analysts) – the admin can be one of the data collectors.</p>

			<h3>How</h3>
				<p class="tab">Collect Earth Online provides step-by-step instructions for creating a training dataset, and we have provided suggestions for CFLR projects below:</p>
